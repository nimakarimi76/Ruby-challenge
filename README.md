# Guidelines

- clone this repo (do **not** fork it)
- solve the levels in ascending order (at least until level 3)
- tag your last commit at the end of each level (something like l1, l2, l3...)
- once you are done, ping us on info@leanbit.it

You can have a look at the higher levels, but please do the **simplest thing** that could work for the level you're currently solving. Suppose that each level is the next version in an agile iteration.

We are interested in seeing code that is:
- clean
- extensible
- robust (don't overlook edge cases, use exceptions where needed, ...)
